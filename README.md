This repository is the place where I practice and introduce some shaders I created
1. Cel Shading
Cel Shading is a non-photorealistic rendering technique used in computer graphics to create objects that appear flat and mimics the visual style of traditional animation or comic book art.
This is the technique is used in games with anime artstyle such as "The Legend of Zelda", "Genshin Impact", etc.

2. Curved World
This shader is used to make bending effect.
Some game using this shader: Subway Surfers, Animal Crossing, Candy Crush Saga, etc.
